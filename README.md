Pintos Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install and set up the Pintos operating system for development.
Prerequisites

Make sure your system is Unix-like, as this is the recommended environment for developing with Pintos.
Required Packages

Before installing Pintos, ensure you have the following packages installed:

bash

sudo apt-get install gcc binutils pkg-config zlib1g-dev libglib2.0-dev gcc libc6-dev autoconf libtool libsdl1.2-dev g++ libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev make qemu qemu-system
sudo apt-get upgrade gcc perl

Installation Steps
1. Download and Extract Pintos

Download the Pintos project and extract it to a directory of your choice. Set the following variables for easier reference:

    $HOME: Path to your home directory (e.g., /home/username).
    $PINTOSHOME: Path to the extracted Pintos project (e.g., /home/username/pintos).

2. Update PATH Variable

To use Pintos utilities like backtrace, pintos, pintos-gdb, pintos-mkdisk, pintos-set-cmdline, and Pintos.pm, you need to add their paths to the PATH environment variable. Add the following line to your $HOME/.bashrc file and restart the terminal:

bash

PATH=$PINTOSHOME/src/utils:$PATH

Replace $PINTOSHOME with the actual path to the Pintos directory.
3. Compile Utilities

Navigate to the utilities directory and compile the necessary files:

bash

cd $PINTOSHOME/src/utils
make

4. Compile Pintos Kernel

Next, compile the Pintos kernel:

bash

cd $PINTOSHOME/src/threads/
make

A new build directory will be created in $PINTOSHOME/src/threads/.
Running Pintos

To test your installation, run the following command:

bash

pintos run alarm-multiple
//or any other test from ./src/test/threads
o
Notes

    You can modify the architecture in the $PINTOSHOME/src/utils/ file by editing line 621:

    perl

    my (@cmd) = ('qemu-system-x86_64');

    Change x86_64 to your desired architecture.

For more detailed instructions and troubleshooting, refer to the Pintos documentation.
